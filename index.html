    console.log () which many of us get confused to. Document.write () is used on HTML page which adds content to HTML.
    Here, log belongs to console, hence we ask log to display the content inside brackets to the console. 
    This console.log () function is mainly used for debugging as this function makes javascript to print the output to console.
    To open the console in the browser, the user needs to right-click on the page, select Inspect and then click on Console.
    console.log () makes it easier to see the value inside a variable. That's why it's commonly used for testing/debugging code.
     The console object also has various methods other than console.log (). To learn more, visit JavaScript console.
